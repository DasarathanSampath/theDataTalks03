where,

- i - Rate of Interest(%)

        we have to compound the interest for every 6 months  
    - Monthly has 12 times compounding in a year, 
        we have to compound the interest for every 12 months   
    - Yearly has 1 time compounding in a year, 
        we have to compound the interest for every 1 month

- t - Total number of periods(years)
