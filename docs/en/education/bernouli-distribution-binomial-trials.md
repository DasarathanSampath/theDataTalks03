## Bernouli distribution

Bernouli distribution contains categorical variables and they are like qualitative attributes. It has only binary out comes like sucess/failure, yes/no, like/dislike, etc.
With a bernouli random variable, we will have only one trial.

There is nothing in between to find a mean or something else.

Success = 1  
Failure = 0  

The mean is calculated using probability weighted sum

µ = (probability of failure)*0 + (probability of success)*1

If the probability of success is p, then the probability failure will be q = (1-p)

Mean = µ = E[X] = (1-p) * 0 + p * 1
         = p    

Variance = ν = σ² = E[(X-µ)²] = Σ(x-µ)²*p(x)  
                  = (1-p)(0-p)² + p (1-p)²  
                  = p² - p³ + p - 2p² + p³  
                  = p(1-P) = pq  

Standard deviation = σ = √(p(1-p)) = √(pq)


If the event is iid (independent identical distribution) then 

(**iid**: all samples are mutually independent & all samples will have the same probability distribution)

Variance of sample mean = ν' = σ²/n

(Please read this article for details [standard Error](http://thedatatalks.in/education/standard-deviation-and-error))

Standard error  = Standard deviation of statistics   
                = SE = √ν' = σ/√n

If the event is fair, then

p = ½  
σ = √(½ * ½) = ½  
SE = 1/(2√n)

**Example:**

SE for a 15 coin flips, If each event is fair & iid

SE = 1/(2√15) = 0.1291 = 12.91%

A set of R commands will return the above value

Generate 1000 rows of trials with each row contain 1500 individual trials  
trials <- matrix(sample(0:1, 15000, TRUE), 1000)

Find means of each row  
meanofrows <- apply(trials, 1, mean)

Find standard deviation of means  
sd(meanofrows) = 0.1266 = 12.66% (This is approximately equal to 12.91%)

## Binomial trials

Binomial trials are generated from iid bernouli trials.

Let X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, X<sub>3</sub> ... X<sub>n</sub> are iid bernouli trials then

\begin{equation}
\text{ The binomial random variable } X = \sum_{i=1}^n X_{i} \\\\  
\text{ Binomial mass function } = P_{X=x} = \left( \begin{array}{c} n \\\\ x \end{array} \right) p^{x} (1-p)^{n-x} \\\\
\text{ Here read } \left( \begin{array}{c} n \\\\ x \end{array} \right) \text{ as n choose x. i.e., } \\\\
\left( \begin{array}{c} n \\\\ x \end{array} \right) = {n! \over x!(n-x)!}
\end{equation}

**Example:**

Probability of getting atleast 7 girls(none are twins) out of 8 children for a parent can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
= \left( \begin{array}{c} 8 \\\\ 7 \end{array} \right) * 0.5^{7} * (1-0.5)^{(8-7)} + \left( \begin{array}{c} 8 \\\\ 8 \end{array} \right) * 0.5^{8} * (1-0.5)^{(8-8)} \\\\
= 0.03516
\end{equation}

A simple R command will give the above value

= choose(8,7) * 0.5^7 * (1-0.5)^(8-7) + choose(8,8) * 0.5^8 * (1-0.5)^(8-8)
=0.03516

(OR)

= pbinom(q=6, size=8, prob=0.5, lower.tail=FALSE)
= 0.03516

Here q = 6 means > 6 values, which are 7 & 8.

## Binomial trials & p-value

Please read this page [p-value](http://thedatatalks.in/education/p-value) before starting this section.

Consider a coin flip of 100 times.

We get 2<sup>100</sup> possible combinations.

If we would like to get 50 heads out of 100 coin flips i.e., probability to get 50 heads {P(X=50)} can be calculated as below.

\begin{equation}
\text{Out of } 2^{100} \text{possible out comes only } \left( \begin{array}{c} 100 \\\\ 50 \end{array} \right) \text{ of them will have exactly 50 heads. Here } \left( \begin{array}{c} 100 \\\\ 50 \end{array} \right) \text{can be read as 100 choose 50 i.e., } = 
{(100! \over 50!(100-50)!)} \\\\
\text{So the probability to get 50 Heads is } \\\\
2^{100} ÷ \left( \begin{array}{c} 100 \\\\ 50 \end{array} \right) = 0.0796 = 7.96%
\end{equation}

A simple R function will return the above value

```R
Density function
dbinom(50, 100, prob = 0.5) 
```
= 0.07958924 = 7.96%

When P(X=50) = 0.0796 then the p-value will be P(X≤49 OR X≥51), which is 1-0.0796 = 0.9204

P(X≥51) can be found using the below formula

\begin{equation}
\left( \begin{array}{c} n \\\\ x \end{array} \right) * P^x * (1-P)^{(n-x)} \\\\
\text{i.e., (consider the coin is not biased)} \\\\
\left( \begin{array}{c} 100 \\\\ 51 \end{array} \right) * 0.5^{51} * (1-0.5)^{(100-51)} + \left( \begin{array}{c} 100 \\\\ 52 \end{array} \right) * 0.5^{52} * (1-0.5)^{(100-52)} + .... + \left( \begin{array}{c} 100 \\\\ 100 \end{array} \right) * 0.5^{100} * (1-0.5)^{(100-100)} = 0.4602 = 46.02%
\end{equation}

A simple R function will return the above value

<div class="codeBlocks">

```R
Cumulative distribution function
pbinom(50, 100, 0.5, lower.tail = FALSE) 
```

</div>

= 0.4602054 = 46.02%

Similarly p-values for other possible observations are given below

|  100 coin flips E(X) = 50) |
|--------------------------------|
| P(X ≤ 49 or X ≥ 51) = 0.9204   |
| P(X ≤ 48 or X ≥ 52) = 0.7644   |
| . . . . . . . .                |
| P(X ≤ 41 or X ≥ 59) = 0.0886   |
| P(X ≤ 40 or X ≥ 60) = 0.0569   |
| P(X ≤ 39 or X ≥ 61) = 0.0352   |
| P(X ≤ 38 or X ≥ 62) = 0.0210   |
| P(X ≤ 37 or X ≥ 63) = 0.0120   |
| P(X ≤ 36 or X ≥ 64) = 0.0066   |
| . . . . . . . .                |
| P(X = 0 or X = 100) = 0.0000   |


When we plot the above values we get the below bell curve. 

<img src="/education/binomial-distribution/coinflip.png" alt="alt text" style="width:100%">

For the above binomial distribution, 
- Null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> = 50 heads
- At 5% significance level (α) we get 95% confidence (1-α)
- We reject H<sub>0</sub>, when we get <40 heads (2.5%) or >60 heads (2.5%).
- i.e., 95% of the time we correctly conclude that the coin is indeed fair
- i.e., 95% of the time we correctly accept H<sub>0</sub>
- i.e., 5% of the time we erroneously conclude that the coin is unfair.
- i.e., 5% of the time we erroneously reject H<sub>0</sub>. This leads to Type-I error. (Fail to accept H<sub>0</sub> when it is true)
