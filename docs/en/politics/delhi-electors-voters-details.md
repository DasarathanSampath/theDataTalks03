The values above each bar represent the polling percentage
(Voters/Electors). And the line across the bar chart represents the
linear model regression line.

As per the **bar chart**, the average increase in electors is calculated
to **27% E-YoY (approximately)**, which is approximately **14%** higher
growth when compared to **India's average elector's growth of 13%**.

The average polling percentage for NCT of Delhi falls at **59.5%**,
which is approximately **0.5%** lower when compared to **India's average
polling percentage of 60%**.

The above mentioned average values are calculated without considering
1951 data since there was a major change in the elector's data from 1951 to
1972.

The total voters in the bar chart for the year 1951 were back-calculated
from reported polling percentage, since NCT of Delhi had dual member &
single-member constituencies.

1972, 1977 & 1983 election details are from **Delhi metropolitan council
election**.

### Male & Female voters:

1951 male/female voting values are not available; hence we have taken
data from the year 1972. The below line chart clearly shows that the male
& female voting percentage is travelling parallel to each other. Always
female voting percentage is slightly lesser than the male voting percentage.

The average percentage of male voters is calculated to **60.29%**, which
is just **0.29%** higher when compared to **India's average polling percentage of 60%**. The average percentage of female voters is
calculated to **58.23%**, which is **1.77%** lower when compared to
**India's average polling percentage of 60%**.
