The political term Left & Right refers to the 17th-century seating arrangement in the French Estates-General.

The people who sat on the left side opposed the monarchy and supported secularism & the people who sat on the right side were supportive of the traditional institutions. The use of the term “Left” become more prominent after 1815.

It is considered by many leaders that social values are as important as economic values for a better society.
