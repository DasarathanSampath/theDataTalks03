After the election, a new third front was formed by National Front parties. The new third front alliance was named as United Front, which consists of National Front parties, Left Front parties, Tamil Manila Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham, Asom Gana Parishad & few other minor parties.  

At first, BJP was given a chance to prove its majority under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and it failed. The government was formed by the Third Front under the leadership of H.D.
