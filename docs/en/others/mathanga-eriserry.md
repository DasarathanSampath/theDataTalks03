### Instructions

In a blender, add shredded coconut and cumin seeds.  
Grind it into a fine paste by sprinkling some water. (If you want the erissery to be dry, then don’t add water while grinding).  
Take ¼th of pumpkin piece and remove the seeds and stringy parts, and wash it thoroughly.   
Slice away the skin and chop it into small pieces.  
In a pan, add the chopped pumpkin pieces, red chili powder, turmeric powder, black pepper powder, salt and water (If you want the erissery to be dry, then add ¼ cup of water or else it will get fully mashed).  
Allow it to cook (once It is almost cooked, take the lid off to absorb the water completely if you want the erissery to be dry).  
Once it is cooked, mash it roughly (don’t mash it completely, leave some pumpkin chunks).   
Add the coconut paste and mix it well.  
For tempering, heat coconut oil in a pan and add cumin seeds, curry leaves, dry red chilies, shredded coconut.  
Stir it occasionally till it turns golden brown.  
Add red chili powder, black pepper powder, turmeric powder and stir it well.   
Then add it to the erissery and mix it well.  
Pumpkin Erissery / MathangaErissery is now ready to serve along with cooked rice!
