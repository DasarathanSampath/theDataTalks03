## Ingredients: 
chicken breasts â€“ 200 gms   
mozzarella cheese - 2 cup   
green cardamom - 5   
vegetable oil - 3 tablespoon   
Peppercorns - 10   
fresh cream- 1/2 cup   
yoghurt (curd) - 3 cup   
coriander leaves - 2 tablespoon   
green chilli - 2 teaspoon   
garlic paste - 2 tablespoon   
ginger paste - 2 tablespoon   
Turmeric - 1/2 teaspoon   
chana dal - 1/2 cup   
1 tablespoon caraway seeds   
1 1/2 egg   
salt as required   

## Instructions:

Step 1 / 5:  

First, wash chicken breasts under running water and pat them dry. Now place them over a chopping board and cut them into cubes of about 2-inches each. Now, grate the cheese in a bowl and keep aside. Then, grind the cardamoms to make a fine powder. 

Step 2 / 5   

Next, add green chillies and water into a blender and blend well to make a fine paste. Also, crush the peppercorns and keep them aside. Meanwhile, place a frying pan over medium flame and dry roast chana dal in it. Once done, let it cool. Now, grind the dal to make a fine powder. 

Step 3 / 5   

Next, take a bowl and add eggs, caraway seeds, cardamom powder, green chilli paste, ginger paste, garlic paste, coriander leaves, roasted chana dal powder, turmeric powder, cream and yoghurt and mix them well. 

Step 4 / 5   

Then, add salt, grated cheese and crushed peppercorns and mix once again. Add the chicken cubes in the bowl and coat the cubes well. Let the chicken marinate for half an hour and once done, place the pieces into skewers. 

Step 5 / 5   

Place a frying pan over medium flame and pour oil in it for shallow frying. Once the oil is hot enough, place the skewers onto the pan. Fry the chicken cubes until golden in colour. Garnish and serve!
