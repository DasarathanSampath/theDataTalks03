Marinate the chicken with the ingredients mentioned and leave to sit for 1 hour. Marination gives extra flavour to the chicken, if you don’t have time to marinate need not worry. Mix the ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. 

Next, deep fry the marinated chicken. keep separate.  

Using a wok and a small amount of oil, fry sombu/fennel seeds, chopped ginger, garlic, red chillies, onion and capsicum. When it’s all browned, remove from the pan and set aside.   

Snip the stem from the green chillies and shake out the seeds. Add the remaining oil and cook the chillies for 1 minute, shaking the pan constantly to prevent them burning.  

Add the fried chicken into the pan, next add spring onions and roasted peanuts, then stir fry for 1 minute more. Add the red chilli sauce and stir for few more minutes until thickened.  

Lastly, add the fried onion capsicum mixture to the pan and give a quick stir. Switch off the flame and your gunpowder chicken makes a great starter.
