First calculate the simple interest for three months.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormula for calculating simple interest is -> i = (P * N * R)/100\\r\\n\\r\\nHere   \\r\\ni = Interest amount   \\r\\nP = Amount(Investment amount)  \\r\\nN = Period(Number of Months)  \\r\\nR = Rate of Interest(Yearly)   \\r\\n\\r\\nExample,  \\r\\n\\r\\nConsider Amount P  = Re 1  \\r\\nPeriod N = 3 Months   \\r\\nRate of Interest R = 6 percent   \\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly the simple interest for 3 months = (PNR)/100 = 1* 3/12* 6/100 = 0.015 (Rupees)\\r\\n\\r\\n2. As calculated above the interest amount of Rs 0.015 is added to the original invested amount of Re 1 (1+0.015=1.015) and this new amount Rs 1.015 will be considered as invested amount for the next quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs stated above interest on interest has to be gained, this method is called as reinvestment.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow simple interest will be calculated for the next quarter for the above mentioned reinvested amount.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterest amount(i)    = PNR/100 (Where P=1.015, N=3 & R = 6%)  \\r\\n                    = 1.015* 3/12* 6/100  \\r\\n                    = 0.015225  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf we now add this interest to the initial amount of Rs 1.015, we will receive the initial amount and compounded interest (ie maturity) at the end of 2 quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaturity amount = 1.015 + 0.015225 = Rs 1.030225\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Thus the maturity amount can be calculated based on the original invested amount and the number of quarters it is invested for.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Instead of calculating maturity amount for each quarter, we can use the below formulae to get the final maturity amount directly\\r\\n\\r\\n**Formula for Fixed Deposit Reinvestment:**\\r\\n\\r\\nMv = [(P *N *R)+1]<sup>Q</sup>\\r\\n\\r\\nHere \\r\\nMv = Maturity amount \\r\\nP = Investment amount(1 Rupee)   \\r\\nN = Period - 3 months  \\r\\nR = Rate of Interest(Yearly) \\r\\nQ = Number of Quarters \\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, If we have to calculate the maturity amount for 2 quarters at 6% rate of interest \\r\\n\\r\\nMv = [(1* 3/12 * 6/100)+1]<sup>2</sup> = 1.030225 (Rupees)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, If we have to calculate the maturity amount for the investment amount of Rs. 15,000/- at 6% rate of interest for 3 years(ie 12 quarters)\\r\\n\\r\\nMv = 15000 * [(1 *3/12 *6/100)+1]<sup>12</sup> = 17,934.27 (Rupees)\\r\\n\\r\\n**\\\"Formula for monthly recurring deposit reinvestment plans:**\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this method, the investment is paid every month. To calculate the maturity amount for this plan, here we are going to follow the Discount factor method.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Note: When the interest is calculated quarterly, the discount factor is used if the customer wants to receive interest on a monthly basis. We will see about the discount factor in another blog.)\\r\\n\\r\\n***Formula for Discount Interest Factor:***  \\r\\n\\r\\n    x = (P * R) / (1200+R)\\r\\n\\r\\nHere,   \\r\\nx = Discount factor \\r\\nP = Investment amount(1 Rupee)  \\r\\nR = Rate of interest(yearly)  \\r\\n\\r\\n***Formula for Maturity amount:***\\r\\n\\r\\nMvrd = ((x+1)<sup>(n+1)</sup> - (x+1)) / (x)\\r\\n\\r\\nHere,    \\r\\nMvrd = Maturity amount   \\r\\nx = Discount factor  \\r\\nn = Number of months  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, If we have to calculate the maturity amount for the recurring monthly amount of Rs. 1,000/- at 6% rate of interest for 3 years(ie 12 quarters)\\r\\n\\r\\nx = (1 * 6)/ (1200+6) = 0.0049751  \\r\\nMvrd    = 1000 * ((0.0049751+1) <sup>(12+1)</sup> - (0.0049751+1)) / (0.0049751)\\r\\n        = 1000 * 12.3952256\\r\\n        = 12,395.23 (Rupees)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<style>   \\r\\n\\r\\n</style>\";"],"mappings":";;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
