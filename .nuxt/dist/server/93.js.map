From 1984 to 1998, the vote bank of INC was\\r\\ndecreasing up to 9.5 crores and it started to increase from 1999 till\\r\\n2019, but there is no remarkable change in vote bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter independence non-congress parties were struggling to prove their\\r\\nexistence till 1977. Bharatiya Lok Dal (BLD) came into power in 1977 and\\r\\nthey got 7 times higher votes (7.81 crores) compared to the previous\\r\\nelection. From then, the vote bank of BJP is growing at a steady-state\\r\\nand they got 22.85 crore votes in 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\\"/blogs/vote-share-and-growth/figure-markdown/img4.png\\\" alt=\\\"alt text\\\" class=\\\"blogs_image\\\">\\r\\n<!-- ![](/blogs/vote-share-and-growth/figure-markdown/img4.png) -->\\r\\n\\r\\nThe below bar chart is a comparison of total seats won by INC against\\r\\ntotal seats won by BJP for each election years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn overall there is a considerable downward trend in seats won by INC.\\r\\nThe first major drop occurred in 1977 (after the emergency period from\\r\\n1975 to 1977) and they have retained the numbers in 1980 & 1984\\r\\nelections.
