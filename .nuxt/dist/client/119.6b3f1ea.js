Apart from the above four parties, **Pattali Makkal\r\nKatchi (PMK)** is having a continuous vote record of 5% to 6% in Tamil\r\nNadu from the year 1991.\r\n\r\nINC was split into two different parties viz., INC(I) & INC(U) for the\r\n1980 election and we have considered INC(I) as INC in our analysis.\r\n\r\nAIADMK was split into three different parties viz., AIADMK, ADK(JL) &\r\nADK(JR) for the 1989 election. We have removed the "1989 AIADMK values"\r\nfrom our analysis.\r\n\r\nThe below bar chart is a comparison of Vote bank for above said four\r\nmajor parties in Tamil Nadu.\r\n\r\nAfter the 1967 election, the vote bank of INC is less compared to the other two major state parties, but they hold a considerable vote bank in Tamil Nadu.\r\n\r\nExcept for the 1996 election, AIADMK holds major vote banks in all elections from 1977.\r\n\r\nThere was a downward movement for DMK vote banks after 1996 election, but they had a good vote share in the 2016 election.\r\n\r\nThe vote bank of BJP is very less and it is growing slowly.\r\n\r\n<img src="/politics/tn-vote-share-and-growth_files/figure-markdown/voting-1.png" alt="alt text" class="blogs_image">\r\n\x3c!-- ![](/politics/tn-vote-share-and-growth_files/figure-markdown/voting-1.png) --\x3e\r\n\r\nThe below bar chart gives the details of winning seats for the four\r\nmajor parties in Tamil Nadu.\r\n\r\nThe total wins for AIADMK are almost very stable from the 1977 year except for the 1996 & 2006 elections. The total wins for DMK are fluctuating, for INC it is completely reducing and for BJP it is very less.\r\n\r\n<img src="/politics/tn-vote-share-and-growth_files/figure-markdown/winning-1.png" alt="alt text" class="blogs_image">\r\n\x3c!-- ![](/politics/tn-vote-share-and-growth_files/figure-markdown/winning-1.png) --\x3e\r\n\r\nBefore the existence of state parties, INC was the only party in power\r\nand they had a strong vote bank (5 to 6 crore) in Tamil Nadu from the\r\nyear 1951 to 1967. INC could not able to contest in 1971 election, due\r\nto the major split occurred in 1969. After 1977 the vote bank of INC in\r\nTamil Nadu is declining or not growing.\r\n\r\nThe vote bank of BJP in Tamil Nadu is very less, but they are\r\ncontinuously growing in a steady state of around 30% E-YoY\r\napproximately.\r\n\r\nCandidates from DMK used to contest the election even before the 1962\r\nelection but without a party name & symbol. The year 1962 was a great\r\nstart for DMK and in the next election (1967) itself, they came into\r\npower and that\'s an end for all national parties in Tamil Nadu. In the\r\nhistory of elections, DMK had three major drops in vote bank,\r\n\r\n1.  1977 drop is due to the split of MG Ramachandran from DMK. Which\r\n    continued up to 1984.\r\n\r\n2.  The 1991 drop is due to the peoples\' aversion to DMK and the rise of J. Jayalalitha in AIADMK after the death of MG Ramachandran.\r\n\r\n3.  2001 drop is due to the peoples\' aversion to DMK on the various\r\n    issues.\r\n\r\nIt was a great start for AIADMK when MG Ramachandran started his own\r\nparty and in the very first election they came into power. And AIADMK\r\ngot to hold for three consecutive elections (1977, 1980, 1984). In the\r\nhistory of elections, AIADMK had two major drops in vote bank,\r\n\r\n1.  1989 drop is due to the death of MG Ramachandran and there was a\r\n    major split in the party.\\\r\n2.  1996 drop is mainly due to the peoples\' aversion to AIADMK. The\r\n    growth of AIADMK from 2001 is extraordinary and the average growth\r\n    from 2001 is about 32% approximately E-YOY.\r\n\r\n<img src="/politics/tn-vote-share-and-growth_files/figure-markdown/performance2-1.png" alt="alt text" class="blogs_image">\r\n\x3c!-- ![](/politics/tn-vote-share-and-growth_files/figure-markdown/performance2-1.png) --\x3e\r\n\r\nThe below line chart shows the Yearly % growth in Votes\r\n((Current-year-votes - Previous-year-votes)/Previous-year-votes) for\r\nfour major parties in Tamil Nadu.\r\n\r\nChange in votes for AIADMK is stable compared to all other parties.\r\n\r\n<img src="/politics/tn-vote-share-and-growth_files/figure-markdown/E-yoy%20growth-1.png" alt="alt text" class="blogs_image">\r\n\x3c!-- ![](/politics/tn-vote-share-and-growth_files/figure-markdown/E-yoy%20growth-1.png) --\x3e\r\n\r\nThe data file in \\*.CSV format can be downloaded from [Party Performance](http://thedatatalks.in/datas/politics/tn-party-performance.csv)\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n\r\n</style>'}}]);
