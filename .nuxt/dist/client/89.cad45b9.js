And the line across the bar chart represents the\r\nlinear model regression line.\r\n\r\nAs per the **bar chart**, the average increase in electors is calculated\r\nto **27% E-YoY (approximately)**, which is approximately **14%** higher\r\ngrowth when compared to **India's average elector's growth of 13%**.\r\n\r\nThe average polling percentage for NCT of Delhi falls at **59.5%**,\r\nwhich is approximately **0.5%** lower when compared to **India's average\r\npolling percentage of 60%**.\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned average values are calculated without considering\r\n1951 data since there was a major change in the elector's data from 1951 to\r\n1972.\r\n\r\nThe total voters in the bar chart for the year 1951 were back-calculated\r\nfrom reported polling percentage, since NCT of Delhi had dual member &\r\nsingle-member constituencies.\r\n\r\n1972, 1977 & 1983 election details are from **Delhi metropolitan council\r\nelection**.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Male & Female voters:\r\n\r\n1951 male/female voting values are not available; hence we have taken\r\ndata from the year 1972. The below line chart clearly shows that the male\r\n& female voting percentage is travelling parallel to each other. Always\r\nfemale voting percentage is slightly lesser than the male voting percentage.\r\n\r\nThe average percentage of male voters is calculated to **60.29%**, which\r\nis just **0.29%** higher when compared to **India's average polling percentage of 60%**. The average percentage of female voters is\r\ncalculated to **58.23%**, which is **1.77%** lower when compared to\r\n**India's average polling percentage of 60%**.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/blogs/delhi-electors-voters-details/figure-markdown/img2.png\" alt=\"alt text\" class=\"blogs_image\">\r\n\x3c!-- ![](/blogs/delhi-electors-voters-details/figure-markdown/img2.png) --\x3e\r\n\r\nThe data file in \\*.CSV format can be downloaded from [Electors & Voters of Delhi](http://thedatatalks.in/datas/politics/delhi-electors.csv) & [Male, Female Voters](http://thedatatalks.in/datas/politics/delhi-male-female-electors.csv)\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n\r\n</style>"}}]);
