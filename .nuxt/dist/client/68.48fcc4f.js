It defines how extreme the test statistics is in the direction of alternative hypothesis. Also it defines the consistancy of a test statistics.\r\n\r\nLet α be the significance level, then (1-α) is the confidence level.  \r\nAssume α = 5% i.e., 95% (1-α) confidence level\r\n\r\nLet H<sub>0</sub> be the null hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIf the calculated p-value is less than α i.e., 5%, then H<sub>0</sub> will be rejected.   \r\ni.e., 5% of the time we would reject null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> wrongly.  \r\ni.e., 5% of the time we erroneously conclude that the coin is unfair.  \r\nThis leads to 5% Type-I error (fail to accept H<sub>0</sub> when it is true)  \r\ni.e., 95% of the time we accept H<sub>0</sub> correctly  \r\ni.e., 95% of the time we correctly conclude that the coin is indeed fair.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSuppose we get p-value just above 5%, then H<sub>0</sub> is accepted and observed data is a rare event.\r\n\r\nPlease read this page for [p-values & binomial trials](http://thedatatalks.in/education/bernouli-distribution-binomial-trials).\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n</style>"}}]);
